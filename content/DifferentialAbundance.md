#### nf-core/DifferentialAbundance

There are a few ways of installing the nf-core pipeline. But this happens automatically when you use a *nexflow run nf-core/* commands.
You can check the ~/.nextflow/assets folders to see what is already installed

```
ls -l ~/.nextflow/assets/nf-core/
```
If you don't see the pipeline, you can pull it from the nf-core website. 
```bash
nextflow pull nf-core/differentialabundance
```
but this happeds automatically when running the nextflow run nf-core/differentialabundance
